# open-humans-standardized-api

A rough draft Open API V3 spec for Open Humans.

It’s got way more than is needed currently, so we could go through it and I can explain what’s there and people could suggest what they want to remove, add, and change (or make pull requests to do so). 

# OpenAPI

OpenAPIv3 specification is currently the most widely used standard starting point for designing an API.  You can use OpenAPIv3 specs to describe all the models and the endpoints that return or accept them.  The same OpenAPIv3 spec file can also be used to generate the API server, the client SDK's for different languages,  and interactive API documentation.

# Editor

https://stoplight.io/ has a very nice visual editor you can use to edit it as well. Using Stoplight you can create OpenAPI descriptions, documentation, mock servers much faster than other API tools, with no specialized knowledge required in one centralized platform.
